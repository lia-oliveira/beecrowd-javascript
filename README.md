# JavaScript - Beecrowd

Beecrowd used to be just a coding challenge platform called URI Judge. Now, it’s a community where challenges and competitions still exist, but it has also become a talent recruitment platform. It’s free and promotes learning through coding competitions. Visit, explore, and join in!

## Why do I use this type of platform?

I find that I can stay focused longer when I'm writing code, and I often discover new ways of doing things. I encounter alternative solutions that I wouldn't consider otherwise, simply because I'm used to a certain way of coding.

This repository is simply a record of solutions that have been approved by the platform. The code here will not run in an IDE without adjustments in the data input section.
